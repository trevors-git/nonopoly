# Nonopoly

_Demonstrate how a adaptable ruleset based on liquid democracy leads to a prosperous humanity_

## Context

The precuror to the game Monopoly was a game named [The Landlord's
Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_board_game_Monopoly#Game_development_1903%E2%80%931934): 

 > In 1903, Georgist Lizzie Magie applied for a patent on a game called The
 > Landlord's Game with the object of showing that rents enriched property
 > owners and impoverished tenants.

In a similar vain it is proposed that a game to be named _Nonopoly_
(pronounced none- opoly) is created to demonstrate the positive attributes
to a society transitioning towards a liquid democracy, where _none_ are in
charge. 

The challenge of developing this game is to adequately capture the complex
mechanisms of a society using a simple rule-set. 

## Objectives of the game 

The two core objectives of the game are to:
 - advance humanity to its greatest point
 - acquire the most amount of legacy points during the gameplay.  

## Game Mechanics

The game begins with a near-standard monopoly rule-set with some basic
modifications to make it more realistic:
 - All players discard money when somebody goes to jail

From here the players then systematically modify the rules of the game through
consensus and voting and change cards. 

Changes to the laws occur through the use of "change" cards
which are collected during gameplay. 

Changes to society can be implemented at whichever rate players
come to consensus on, however, if rules are changed to drastically
or radically, or quickly, there may be unforeseen consequences 
which hinders the advancement of humanity and damage a players legacy. 

Potential change cards include:
 - upgrade the jail to correctional facility
 - demolish the jail
 - Develop a technology (cost money, gain legacy) 
   - Agriculture
   - Space 
   - Computer
   - Media (social media etc.)  
   -   

Each rotation of the board increases the year 


## Game Conclusion

The game concludes when either:
 - the year 2050 has been reached
 - the cost of living is reduced to $1 per year per person (money is abolished)
 - any player goes bankrupt (everyone loses)

## Production

Nonopoly should be developed as an adaption kit to a monolopy boardgame. Namely
it will utilize the monopoly board games: 
 - Board
 - Player Pieces
 - Houses/Hotels
 - Money

In addition the following must be produced:
 - Revised ruleset booklet
 - Change Cards
 - Event Cards
 - Year Counter
